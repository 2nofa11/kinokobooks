<h1>Learn from Architects of Buildings</h1>
</header>

<p><i>&#x201c;Architecture is a social act and the material theater of human activity.&#x201d;</i>&mdash;Spiro Kostof
</p><p>How many software architects see their role as exclusively, or
primarily technical? Is it not rather that they are the conciliators,
go&ndash;betweens and arbiters of the warring factions among the
stake-holders? How many approach their work in a purely intellectual
spirit, without giving proper weight to the human factors of their job?
</p><p><i>&#x201c;A great architect is not made by way of a brain nearly so much as he is made by way of a cultivated, enriched heart.&#x201d;</i>&mdash;Frank Lloyd Wright
</p><p>What more strongly marks out the architects in your
organization: raw intellectual horsepower and vast capacity to recall
technical minutia, or taste, refinement and generosity of spirit? Under
which tendency would you prefer to work?
</p><p><i>&#x201c;A doctor can bury his mistakes but an architect can only advise his client to plant vines.&#x201d;</i>&mdash;ibid
</p><p>Is the "maintenance" of "legacy" systems anything more than
pruning those vines? Would you, as an architect, have the intestinal
fortitude to scrap a piece of work that had failed? Or would you cover
it up? Wright also said that the architect's best friend was the
sledgehammer. What have you demolished recently?
</p><p><i>&#x201c;Architects believe that not only do they sit at the right hand of God, but that if God ever gets up, they take the chair&#x201d;</i>&mdash;Karen Moyer
</p><p>For "God" read "customer".
</p><p><i>&#x201c;In architecture as in all other operative arts, the end must</i>
direct the operation. The end is to build well. Well building has three
conditions: Commodity, Firmness and Delight.&#x201d;<i>&mdash;Henry Watton</i>
</p><p>When was the last time you saw a piece of software who's architecture gave you any <i>delight</i>? Do you aim to give delight with your work?
</p><p><i>"No person who is not a great sculptor or painter can be an</i>
architect. If he is not a sculptor or painter, he can only be a builder"<i>&mdash;John Ruskin</i>
</p><p>Does artistry play its proper part in your architecture? Is the
assemblage of components to make systems informed by a painterly
concern for shape and texture, with a sculptural sense of balance and
implied motion, of the importance of negative space?
</p><p>And finally, no gloss is required on this comment, a sure remedy for the software architect's most damaging syndrome.
</p><p><i>"It seems a fantastic paradox, but it is nevertheless a most</i>
important truth, that no architecture can be truly noble which is not
imperfect."<i>&mdash;ibid</i>
