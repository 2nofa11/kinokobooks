<h1>Dwarves, Elves, Wizards, and Kings</h1>
</header>

<p>In Cryptonomicon, Randy Waterhouse explains his classification
system for the different types of people he meets. Dwarves are hard
workers, steadily producing beautiful artifacts in the dark loneliness
of their caves. They exert tremendous forces moving mountains and
shaping earth, and are renowned for their craftsmanship. Elves are
elegant, cultured, and spend their days creating new and beautiful
magical things. They are so gifted they don't even realize that other
races view these things as otherworldly almost. The wizards are
immensely powerful beings almost completely unlike all others, but
unlike the Elves, they do know about magic, and its power and nature,
and wield it with supreme effect. But there is a fourth type of
character that Waterhouse alludes to but does not mention specifically.
The Kings are the visionaries who know what must be done with all of
these different characters.
</p><p>An Architect is a King of sorts. The Architect must be familiar
with all of these characters, and ensure that the architecture has
roles for all of these characters. An architecture designed only for
one will only attract that one character to the project, and even with
the best dwarves, or elves, or wizards, the team will be severely
limited in its reach if it can only approach problems in one way.
</p><p>A good king will lead all types through a quest, and help them
work together to complete it. Without the quest, there is no vision for
the team, and it ultimately becomes a partisan mess. Without all
characters, the team can only solve one class of problem, and is
stopped at the first barrier impassable to that solution. 
The architect creates the quest with all the characters in
mind. The architecture then becomes a guide for finding tasks for the
different characters to perform while learning about each other. When a
project encounters difficulty, the team will already know how to
approach solving it because the architecture gave them the
opportunities to grow into a team.
