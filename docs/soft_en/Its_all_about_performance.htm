<h1>It's all about performance</h1>
</header>

<p>Imagine a personal vehicle that is roomy, comfortable, fuel
efficient, inexpensive to produce, and 98% recyclable. You want one?
Sure. Everyone does. Just one problem: Its top speed is 6 miles/hour
(10 km/hour). Still want one? This small example demonstrates that performance is just as important as any
other criterion.
</p><p>The reason many designers put performance at the bottom of
their lists might be that computers are so much faster at computation
than their human counterparts, that they assume that the speed of the
system will be acceptable. And if today's systems aren't fast enough,
Moore's Law will take care of everything. But hardware speed is only
part of the system.
</p><p>Performance is sometimes thought of as a simple measurement of
the time it takes for a system to respond to user input. But system
designers must consider many aspects of performance, including
performance of the analysts and programmers who implement the design;
performance of the human interactions of the system; and performance of
the non-interactive components.
</p><p>Performance of the people building the system is often called
productivity, and it is important because it directly affects the cost
and schedule of the project. A team that delivers a project late and
over budget has a lot of 'splainin' to do. Using tools and pre-built
components can dramatically affect how quickly the system can be built
and start returning value.
</p><p>Performance of the human interactions is critical to acceptance
of the system. Many factors of system design contribute to this aspect
of performance, response time being perhaps the most obvious. But
response time is not the only factor. Just as important are
intuitiveness of the interface and number of gestures required to
achieve a goal, both of which directly affect performance.
</p><p>More than response time per se, a good system specification
will measure task time, defined as the time required to complete a
domain-specific task, including all human interactions with the system.
In addition to system response time, this measurement includes operator
think time and operator data entry time, which are not under the
control of the system. But including these times gives motivation to
the proper design of the human interface. Proper attention to the way
information is presented and the number of gestures required to
complete the task will result in better human operational performance.
</p><p>Performance of the non-interactive components is equally important to
the success of the system. For example, a "nightly" batch run that
takes more than 24 hours to complete will result in an unusable system.
Performance of the disaster recovery component is also a critical
consideration. In case of total destruction of one part of the system,
how quickly can operational status be restored, in order to allow
normal business to resume?
</p><p>When considering the implementation and operation of a
successful system, architects and designers should always pay careful
attention to performance.
