<h1>The title of software architect has only lower-case 'a's; deal with it</h1>

<p>A disappointing trend has been in bloom for some time now within
software development; the attempt to professionalize the practice of
software architecture as one on par with the classical school of
Architecture. This seems to stem from some need for further
legitimization of one's accomplishment beyond acknowledgment among
one's peers and employer. By comparison, Architecture itself was not
professionalized until the late 19th century, at least a few millennia
after the practice had been around. It would be no great stretch to say
that some software architects seem a bit eager by comparison.
</p><p>Software architecture is a craft, and it certainly takes
practice and discipline to achieve success in the field. That said,
software development is still a relatively nascent endeavor. We don't
even know enough about this practice to adequately professionalize it.
Despite its youth, software development's product has become a highly
valued tool, and as such, the accomplished individuals (as well as
those who wish to be seen as accomplished) have enjoyed levels of
compensation on par with the leading professional fields, including
medicine, accounting, and law.
</p><p>Practitioners of software development enjoy considerable
compensation for work that is highly creative and exploratory. The
fruits of our labors have been used to accomplish many significant
milestones, some that benefit all of mankind. The barriers to entry are
largely one's own merit and opportunity; the fully-professionalized
fields undergo programs of study and internship that dwarf our own.
Dwell on that for a moment and ponder how much cause we have to be
content, and just how brash it is to insist that software architect be
considered a title that sits as peer to Lawyer, Doctor, and Architect.
