<h1>Prefer principles, axioms and analogies to opinion and taste</h1>
</header>

<p>When
creating your architecture you should explicitly use principles, axioms
and analogies to guide the creation.  This gives the architecture a
number of benefits that are not present if you simply create by
implicitly leveraging your experience, opinions and tastes.
</p><p>Documenting
your architecture will be easier.  You can start by describing the
principles that were followed.  This is much easier than trying to
communicate your opinions and experience.  The principles will then
provide a convenient handle for those tasked with understanding and
implementing the architecture.  It will also be invaluable for
subsequent or inexperienced architects who need to work with the
architecture.
</p><p>An architecture with clear principles is an
architecture that frees its architect from reviewing everything and
being everywhere.  It gives architects greater leverage and influence. 
You will not need to be an omniscient workaholic to ensure that others
can consistently:
</p>
<ul><li> implement and adapt the architecture;
</li><li> extend the architecture into related domains;
</li><li> re-implement the architecture using newer technologies;
</li><li> work out the detailed edge cases.
</li></ul>
<p>Disagreements
about opinion and taste invariably turn into political arguments in
which authority is used to win.  However, disagreements where the
foundation principles are clear provide a way for more reasoned
discussion to occur without issues being personalised.  It also allows
the disagreements to be resolved without reference to the architect at
all. 
</p><p>Principles and axioms also give an architecture
consistency throughout its implementation and across time.  Consistency
is often a problem, especially in large systems that span multiple
technologies and will exist for many years.  Clear architectural
principles allow those unfamiliar with a particular technology or
component to reason about and more readily understand the unfamiliar
technology.
