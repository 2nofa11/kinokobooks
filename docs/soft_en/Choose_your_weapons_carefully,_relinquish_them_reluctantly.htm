<h1>Choose your weapons carefully, relinquish them reluctantly</h1>
</header>

<p>As
a seasoned veteran of software design and implementation, every
architect is armed with an array of weapons they've used with repeated
success. For one reason or another, these technologies have found
favor and bubbled to the top of our list of preferred solutions. Most
likely they've earned their rightful place in your arsenal by defeating
fierce competition. Despite this, a barrage of new technologies
constantly threatens their position. We are often compelled to lay
down our weapons of choice for these new alternatives but don't be too
quick to dismiss your trusty armaments. To cast them aside for
alternatives that haven't been proven through similar trials is a risky
proposition.
</p><p>This doesn't mean that once established on our list
of favorites a technology is granted infinite tenure and it certainly
doesn't mean that you can bury your head in the sand and ignore
advancements in software development. For each technology the time
will come when it needs to be replaced. Technology moves quickly and
superior solutions are on the way. As architects we need to stay
abreast of industry trends, we just don't need to be the first to
embrace fledgling technology. There's usually no huge advantage to
being the first to adopt new technology but there can be several
drawbacks. 
</p><p>To justify the risk involved with selecting new
technology its benefits should be a quantum leap forward.  Many new
technologies claim such advancement but few deliver it.  It's easy to
look at new technology and see technical advantages but those benefits
are often difficult to sell to stakeholders.  Before you decide to
blaze a trail with new technology, ask yourself how the business will
benefit from this decision.  If the best outcome from a business
perspective is that no one will notice, rethink your decision. 
</p><p>Another
important thing to acknowledge is cost associated to the shortcomings
of new technology.  These costs can be high and are difficult to
calculate.  When you're working with familiar technology you're aware
of its idiosyncrasies.  It's na&#xef;ve to think that a new technology won't
come with its own collection of pitfalls.  Adding problems that you
haven't solved before will destroy your estimates.  You're far more
aware of the costs involved when implementing solutions using familiar
technology.
</p><p>One last thing to consider is future relevance.  It
would be nice if we could simply identify and select superior
technologies but things aren't quite that simple.  Great technologies
don't always win.  Trying to predict the winners early is a gamble that
doesn't yield a large payoff.  Wait for the hype to die down and see if
the technology settles into a space of usefulness.  You'll find many
just go away.  Don't jeopardize your project for a technology that
doesn't have a future.
</p><p>
Selecting the technologies we use to
attack problems with is a large part of the software architect's job. 
Choose your weapons carefully and relinquish them reluctantly.  Let
your past success help to ensure future success and evolve your
technology stack cautiously.
