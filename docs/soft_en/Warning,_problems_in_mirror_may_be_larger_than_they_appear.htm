<h1>Warning, problems in mirror may be larger than they appear</h1>
</header>

<p>I've
worked on hundreds of software projects. Every one had issues that
caused more problems than the team expected. Often, a small part of the
team identified the issue early on and the majority dismissed or
ignored it because they didn't understand how important it really was
until it was too late.
</p><p>
The forces at work include:  
</p>
<ul><li> Issues that seemed trivial early in the project become critical after it is too late to fix them. While the boiling frog experiment may be folk-lore, it's a useful analogy for what happens in many projects.  
</li><li> Individuals often face resistance when the rest of the team does not share their
experience or knowledge. Overcoming this resistance requires unusual
courage, confidence and persuasiveness. It rarely happens, even with
highly paid, experienced consultants specifically hired to help avoid
such problems.
</li>
<li> Most software developers are optimists. Painful experience teaches us to
temper our optimism, but without specific experience we tend toward
optimism. Natural pessimists on development teams are often unpopular,
even if they are consistently right. Few people will risk this
reputation and take a stand against the majority without a very
solid case. Most of us have had the "This makes me uncomfortable, but I
can't explain why" feeling, but sharing it rarely wins any arguments. 
</li>
<li> Every team member has a different view of what is more or less important.
Their concerns are often focused on their personal responsibilities,
not the project's goals. 
</li>
<li> We all have blind spots; short-comings that are difficult for us to recognize or to accept. 
Some possible strategies to counter-act these forces could include: 
</li>
<li> Establish an organized approach to managing risks. One simple approach is to
track risks the same way you track bugs. Any one can identify a
risk and each risk is tracked until it is no longer a risk. Risks are
prioritized and reviewed when their status changes or when there is new
information. This helps remove emotion from the discussion and makes it
easier to remember to re-evaluate them periodically. 
</li>
<li>When going against the majority, look for ways to help the rest of the team
understand more easily. Encourage any team you're on to recognize
the value in dissenting opinions and look for neutral ways to discuss
them. 
</li>
<li> "Bad smells" are worth recognizing. If the facts aren't there yet, look for the simplest tests that would provide the facts.  
</li><li> Constantly test your understanding against the team and the customer. Tools such
as a prioritized list of user stories can help but are no substitute
for regular communications with the customer and an open mind.  
</li>
<li> Blind spots are, by definition, hard to recognize. People you trust to tell
you the hard truth when you need it are a precious resource. 
</li></ul>
