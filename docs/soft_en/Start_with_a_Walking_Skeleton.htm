<h1>Start with a Walking Skeleton</h1>
</header>

<p>One very useful strategy for implementing, verifying, and evolving an application architecture is to start with what Alistair Cockburn  calls a Walking Skeleton
.  A Walking Skeleton is a minimal, end-to-end implementation of the
system that links together all the main architectural components. 
Starting small, with a working system exercising all the communication
paths, gives you confidence that you are heading in the right direction.
</p><p>Once
the skeleton is in place, it's time to put it on a workout
program. Bulk it up with full body workouts.  This means implement
incrementally, adding end-to-end functionality.  The goal is to keep
the system running, all the while growing the skeleton.
</p><p>Making
changes to an architecture is harder and more expensive the longer it
has been around and the bigger it gets.  We want to find mistakes
early.  This approach gives us a short feedback cycle, from which we
can more quickly adapt and work iteratively as necessary to meet the
business' prioritized list of runtime -discernable  quality
attributes.  Assumptions about the architecture are validated earlier. 
The architecture is more easily evolved because problems are found at
an earlier stage when less has been invested in its implementation.
</p><p>The
bigger the system, the more important it is to use this strategy.  In a
small application, one developer can implement a feature from top to
bottom relatively quickly, but this becomes impractical with larger
systems.  It is quite common to have multiple developers on a single
team or even on multiple, possibly distributed teams involved in
implementing end-to-end.  Consequently, more coordination is
necessary.  And naturally, developers implement at a different pace.  Some developers can accomplish a lot and in little time while others can spend a lot of time implementing very little. More difficult and time consuming efforts should be done earlier in the project.
