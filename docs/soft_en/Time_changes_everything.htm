<h1>Time changes everything</h1>
</header>

<p>One of the things I've been most entertained by as the years have
gone by, is observing what things have lasted and what haven't. So many
patterns, frameworks, paradigm changes, and algorithms, all argued for
with passion by smart people, thinking of the long term, balancing all
the known issues, have not warranted more than a yawn over the long
haul. Why? What is history trying to tell us? 
<p>

<h2>Pick a worthy challenge</h2>

<p>
This one is tricky for a software architect. Challenges or
problems are given to us, so we don't have the luxury of choosing,
right? It's not that simple. First of all we often make the mistake of
believing that we can't influence what we are asked to do. Usually we
can, but it gets us out of our comfort zone in the technology space.
There are dragons there when we don't choose to do the right things.
Time passes, we have worked diligently and hard solving the requested
challenge, and in the end it doesn't matter: we didn't do what was
really needed and our work is wasted. Over time, a good solution to the
right challenge will probably outlast all others. 
</p>

<h2>Simple rules</h2>

<p>
We say it to ourselves: keep it simple stupid. We say it but we
don't do it. We don't do it because we don't have to. We are smart and
we can handle some complexity and easily justify it because it adds
agility to our design, because it is more elegant to our aesthetic
sensibilities, because we believe we can anticipate the future. Then
time passes, you walk away from the project for a year or more. When
you come back look at it, you almost always wonder why you did what you
did. If you had to do it all over again, you would probably do it
differently. Time does this to us. It makes us look silly. It is good
to realize this early and get over yourself, and really try to learn
what simple means in the lens that only time can grind. 
</p>

<h2>Be happy with that old stuff</h2>

<p>
Architects love to search for the &#x201c;one true way&#x201d;, the
methodology, or school of thought that provides the predictability we
crave and the clear answers that always seem just out of reach. The
problem is that whatever guiding light you have in one year will
probably not match the guiding light you have in a couple of years,
much less a decade later. As you look back, you will always be looking
at designs that don't match your current expectations. Learn to embrace
that old stuff, and resist the temptation to think you should go back
and &#x201c;fix&#x201d; it. Was the solution an appropriate one for the problem? Did
it solve the needs of the problem? Keep these as your measure, you will
be a lot happier.
