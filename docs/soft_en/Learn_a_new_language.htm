<h1>Learn a new language</h1>
</header>

<p>To be successful as an architect,
you must be able to make yourself understood by people who don't speak
your native tongue. No. I'm not suggesting you learn Esperanto or even
Klingon, but you should at least speak basic Business, and Testing.
And, if you aren't fluent in Programmer, you should make that a top
priority.
</p><p>If you don't see the value in learning other
languages, consider the following scenario. The business people want a
change made to an existing system, so they call a meeting with the
architect and programmers to discuss it. Unfortunately, none of the
technical team speaks Business and none of the business people speak
Programmer. The meeting will likely go something like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A
business person talks for a minute about the need for a relatively
simple enhancement to an existing product, and explains how making the
change will enable the sales team to increase both market and mind
share.
</li>
<li> While the business person is still speaking,
the architect starts sketching some kind of occult symbols on a notepad
and enters into quiet argument with the one of the programmers in their
strange multi-syllabic tongue.
</li>
<li> Eventually the business person finishes and looks expectantly at the architect.
</li>
<li> After
the whispered argument completes, the architect walks to the whiteboard
and begins drawing several complex diagrams that are supposed to
represent multiple views of the existing system while explaining (in
complex technical terms) why the requested enhancement is virtually
impossible without major changes and may actually require a complete
redesign/rewrite of the entire system.
</li>
<li> The business
people (who understood little of the diagram and less of the
explanation) are openly stunned and find it hard to believe that
something so simple would require such massive changes. They begin to
wonder if the architect is serious or just making things up to avoid
making the change.
</li>
<li> Meanwhile, the architect and
programmers are just as surprised that the business people don't see
how the &#x201c;minor&#x201d; change will require major modifications to the core
system functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And therein lies the problem. Neither
group understands how the other thinks, or what half of the words they
use means. This leads to mistrust and miscommunication. It's a basic
psychological principle that people are more comfortable with those who
are similar to them as opposed to those who are different from them.
</p><p>Imagine
how the above scenario might change if the architect were able to
explain the issues to the business folk in terms they understand and
relay the business issues to the programmers in terms they understand.
Instead of surprise and mistrust, the result would be agreement and
approval.
</p><p>I'm not saying that learning multiple languages will
cure all your problems, but it will help prevent the miscommunications
and misunderstandings that lead to problems.
</p><p>For those of you who decide this makes sense, I wish you success on your journey. Or, as the Klingons say, Qapla!
