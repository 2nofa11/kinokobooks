<h1>The User Acceptance Problem</h1>
</header>

<p>People aren't always
happy about new systems or major upgrades. This can pose a threat to
the successful completion of a project.
</p><p>It's not uncommon for
people to disagree with the decision to implement a new system -
especially at the beginning.  This should be expected and the reasons
noted. However, initial reactions to a new system is less of a concern
than a sustained negative reaction.
</p><p>Your goal as an Architect is
to be aware of and measure the threat of acceptance problems and work
towards mitigating those threats. To do this you have to be cognizant
of them and consider the reasons for them.  Some of the more common
reasons are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>People may have concerns about the need for
a new system (and subsequent retirement of an old system). This can
also include fear of loosing functionality or loosing influence or
power when roles change.</li>
<li>People fear new (unproven) technology.</li>
<li>People have cost/budget concerns</li>
<li>People simply do not like change.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each
of these reasons requires different possible solutions. Some of which
you can address and others you can't. You have to recognize the
difference and deal quickly with those that you can. Start early,
having discussions with your end users about the new system and its
real and perceived benefits and disadvantages.  The most effective long
term solution is to use the design of the system itself to address the
concerns. Other effective solutions include training, scheduled system
demonstrations (early in the project lifecycle) and sharing knowledge
of what users will get with a new system.
</p><p>A &#x201c;Project
Champion&#x201d; can help avoid user acceptance problems. Ideally this should
be a person that represents the user group or stakeholders. They
sometimes have to be convinced themselves. If there is none then push
for one from the very beginning. Once you've recruited a Project
Champion, give them your assistance in every way you can.
