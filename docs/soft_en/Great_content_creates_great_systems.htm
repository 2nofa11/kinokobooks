<h1>Great content creates great systems</h1>
</header>

<p>I have seen my fair share of initiatives focus endlessly on requirements,
design, development, security &amp; maintenance but not on the actual
point of the system &ndash; the data.  This is especially true in
content-based systems in which the data is information delivered as
unstructured or semi-structured content.   Great content means the difference between a system that is hollow and one that is relevant.
</p><p>Content
is king. Content is the network. Content is theinterface. In an
increasingly interconnected world, content quality is rapidly becoming
the difference between success and failure. FaceBook vs. Orkut /Google
vs. Cuil / NetFlix vs. BlockbusterOnline.... the list is endless
where battles have been won and lost on the content battlefield. One
could argue that content-related aspects are not the software
architect's problem - but I think the next decade will certainly
disprove that.
</p><p>
Part of the design process for a
new system should be devoted assessing content inventory. Designing an
effective domain/object/data model is not enough.
</p><p>
Analyze all available content and assess its value on the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there enough content available? If not, how do we attain critical mass?</li>
<li>Is the content fresh enough? If not, how do we improve delivery rates?</li>
<li>Have all possible content channels been explored? RSS feeds, Email, Paper Forms are all channels.</li>
<li>Are there effective input streams built to facilitate the continual
delivery of this content into the system? It's one thing to
identify valuable content, but another thing altogether to harvest it
regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Make no mistake, the success of a
system depends on its content. Spend a healthy part of the design
process to assess the value of your content. If your findings are less
than satisfactory then that's a red flag and the stakeholders must be
advised about. I have seen many systems that fulfill all contractual
obligations, meet every requirement and still fail because this fairly
obvious aspect was ignored. Great content creates great systems.
