<h1>Challenge assumptions - especially your own</h1>
</header>

<p>
Wethern's Law of Suspended Judgement states (in a rather
tongue-in-cheek fashion) that "Assumption is the mother of all
screw-ups." A more popular take on this would be, "Don't assume - it
makes an 'ass' of 'u' and 'me'." But when you are dealing with
assumptions that could cost thousands, if not millions of dollars, it's
not always a laughing matter.
</p><p>
Best practices in
software architecture state that you should document the rationale
behind each decision that is made, especially when that decision
involves a trade-off (performance versus maintainability, cost versus
time-to-market, and so on). In more formal approaches, it is common to
record along with each decision the context of that decision, including
the "factors" that contributed to the final judgement. Factors may be
functional or non-functional requirements, but they also may just be
"facts" (or factoids...) that the decision-makers found important
(technology constraints, available skill sets, the political
environment, etc.).
</p><p>
This practice is valuable because
by way of listing these factors, it helps highlight assumptions that
the architects may have that are affecting important decisions
regarding the software that is being designed. Very often these
assumptions are based on "historical reasons", opinion, developer lore,
FUDs, or even "something I heard in the hallway":
</p>
<ul><li> "Open source is not reliable"
</li><li> "Bitmap indexes are more trouble than they're worth"
</li></ul>
<ul><li> "The customer would NEVER accept a page that takes 5 seconds to load"
</li><li> "The CIO would reject anything that isn't sold by a major vendor"
</li></ul>
<p>It
is important to make these assumptions visible and explicit for the
sake of posterity and for future re-evaluation. However, it is even
more critical to make sure that any assumptions that aren't based on
relevant empirical evidence (or a confirmation from the people
involved, for political factors) be validated before a decision is
finalized. What if customers can wait 5 seconds for critical reports if
you provide a counter? In exactly what way is exactly which open source
project unreliable? Have you tested the bitmap indexes on your data,
using your application's transactions and queries?
</p><p>And
don't overlook the word "relevant." Something that was true in an older
version of your software may not be true today. The performance of
bitmap indexes in one version of Oracle may not be the same as in
another. An older version of a library may have had security holes that
have already been fixed. Your old reliable software vendor may be on
their last legs financially. The technology landscape changes every
day, and so do people. Who knows? Maybe your CIO has become a closet
fan of Linux.
</p><p>Facts and assumptions are the
pillars on which your software will be built. Whatever they are, make
sure the foundations are solid.
