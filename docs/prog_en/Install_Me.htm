</header>

<p>I am not the slightest bit interested in your program.
</p>
<p>I am surrounded by problems and have a to-do list as long as my arm. The only reason I am at your website right now is because I have heard an unlikely rumor that every one my problems will be eliminated by your software. You'll forgive me if I'm skeptical.
</p>
<p>If eyeball tracking studies are correct, I've already read the title and I'm scanning for blue underlined text marked <i>download now</i>. As an aside, if I arrived at this page with a Linux browser from a UK IP, chances are I would like the Linux version from a European mirror, so please don't ask. Assuming the file dialog opens straight away, I consign the thing to my download folder and carry on reading.
</p>
<p>We all constantly perform cost-benefit analysis of everything we do. If your project drops below my threshold for even a second, I will ditch it and go onto something else. Instant gratification is best.
</p>
<p>The first hurdle is <i>install</i>. Don't think that's much of a problem? Go to your download folder now and have a look around. Full of <i>tar</i> and <i>zip</i> files right? What percentage of those have you unpacked? How many have you installed? If you are like me, only a third are doing little more than acting as hard drive filler.
</p>
<p>I may want doorstep convenience, but I don't want you entering my house uninvited. Before typing <i>install</i> I would like to know exactly where you are putting stuff. It's my computer and I like to keep it tidy when I can. I also want to be able to remove your program the instant I am disenchanted with it. If I suspect that's impossible I won't install it in the first place. My machine is stable right now and I want to keep it that way.
</p>
<p>If your program is GUI based then I want to do something simple and see a result. Wizards don't help, because they do stuff that I don't understand. Chances are I want to read a file, or write one. I don't want to create projects, import directories, or tell you my email address. If all is working, on to the tutorial.
</p>
<p>If your software is a library, then I carry on reading your web page looking for a <i>quick start</i> guide. I want the equivalent of "Hello world" in a five-line no-brainer with exactly the output described by your website. No big XML files or templates to fill out, just a single script. Remember, I have also downloaded your rival's framework. You know, the one who always claims to be so much better than yours in the forums? If all is working, onto the tutorial.
</p>
<p>There is a tutorial isn't there? One that talks to me in language I can understand?
</p>
<p>And if the tutorial mentions my problem, I'll cheer up. Now I'm reading about the things I can do it starts to get interesting, fun even. I'll lean back and sip my tea &mdash; did I mention I was from the UK? &mdash; and I'll play with your examples and learn to use your creation. If it solves my problem, I'll send you a thank-you email. I'll send you bug reports when it crashes, and suggestions for features too. I'll even tell all my friends how your software is the best, even though I never did try your rival's. And all because you took such care over my first tentative steps.
</p>
<p>How could I ever have doubted you?
