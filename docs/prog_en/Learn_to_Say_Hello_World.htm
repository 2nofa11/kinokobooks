<p>Paul Lee, username <code>leep</code>, more commonly known as Hoppy, had a reputation as the local expert on programming issues. I needed help. I walked across to Hoppy's desk and asked, could he take a look at some code for me?
</p>
<p>Sure, said Hoppy, pull up a chair. I took care not to topple the empty cola cans stacked in a pyramid behind him.
</p>
<p>What code?
</p>
<p>In a function in a file, I said.
</p>
<p>So let's take a look at this function. Hoppy moved aside a copy of K&amp;R and slid his keyboard in front of me.
</p>
<p>Where's the IDE? Apparently Hoppy had no IDE running, just some editor which I couldn't operate. He grabbed back the keyboard. A few keystrokes later and we had the file open &mdash; it was quite a big file &mdash; and were looking at the function &mdash; it was quite a big function. He paged down to the conditional block I wanted to ask about.
</p>
<p>What would this clause actually do if <code>x</code> is negative? I asked. Surely it's wrong. 
</p>
<p>I'd been trying all morning to find a way to force <code>x</code> to be negative, but the big function in the big file was part of a big project, and the cycle of recompiling then rerunning my experiments was wearing me down. Couldn't an expert like Hoppy just tell me the answer?
</p>
<p>Hoppy admitted he wasn't sure. To my surprise, he didn't reach for K&amp;R. Instead, he copied the code block into a new editor buffer, re-indented it, wrapped it up in a function. A short while later he'd coded up a <code>main</code> function that looped forever, prompting the user for input values, passing them to the function, printing out the result. He saved the buffer as a new file, <code>tryit.c</code>. All of this I could have done for myself, though perhaps not as quickly. But his next step was wonderfully simple and, at the time, quite foreign to my way of working:
</p>
<pre>$ cc tryit.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out
</pre>
<p>Look! His actual program, conceived just a few minutes earlier, was now up and running. We tried a few values and confirmed my suspicions (so I'd been right about something!) and <i>then</i> he cross-checked the relevant section of K&amp;R. I thanked Hoppy and left, again taking care not to disturb his cola can pyramid.
</p>
<p>Back at my own desk, I closed down my IDE. I'd become so used to working on a big project within a big product I'd started to think that was what I should be doing. A general purpose computer can do little tasks too. I opened a text editor and began typing.
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>
