<h1>Recognize the Value of Team Morale</h1>

<p>Morale is one of those things you know you need, but it is hard to grow and measure. A team with high morale will occasionally put in extra effort cheerfully, but a team with low morale will not. High morale isn't just about a better workplace, it is about a more productive team.
</p><p>A few years ago I worked with a team that exhibited high morale. At times, the office felt more like a community of friends than a workplace. Productivity was high. We would occasionally have crises that required a little extra &#x201c;push&#x201d;, and team members would volunteer for that extra effort.
</p><p>I few years later, I saw that same team at an ice cream social at the office, and they didn't appear happy. They weren't socializing, and their body language seemed cold. When I approached them, they were complaining that there were only &#x201c;chocolate Jimmies, not colored sprinkles&#x201d; as a topping for the ice cream. Think about that transition; same team, same project, much different morale. They went from cheerfully working overtime, when needed, to complaining about free ice cream.
</p><p>How did this happen? The team had a new manager who made some bad decisions. His errors led the team down a false path and created more work for them. Senior management blamed the entire team. And when the manager took no responsibility, the team lost confidence. The project became &#x201c;more work and less fun&#x201d;, and morale suffered.
</p><p>As the manager tried to improve the situation, he made things worse. &#x201c;When the team had high morale, they would occasionally go out to movies together,&#x201d; he remembered. So he instituted a &#x201c;movie night&#x201d;. The team had no interest in socializing and attendance was low. The manager began marking on performance reviews that people weren't &#x201c;participating with the team&#x201d;. That lowered morale even more.
</p><p>In this situation, the manager had the cause and effect backwards. People don't have high team morale because they socialize, they are more willing to socialize because they have high morale.
</p><p>As a consultant, I have tried to think about ways to measure morale. I have joked about metrics like &#x201c;the ratio of cars in the parking lot at 5:05 pm and 4:55 pm&#x201d;, and the &#x201c;number of visible Dilbert cartoons per square foot of office space&#x201d;. But I have realized morale isn't something to be measured, morale <i>IS the measurement</i>. We are measuring the team's attitude. Morale is the measure of the team's confidence in their leader, confidence in their teammates, and faith in the team's ability to get things done.
</p><p>It is your job as the software project manager to create a workplace with high morale. If the team respects you as their leader, and if they feel they can talk to you and influence the outcome of events, morale will improve.
</p><p>High morale results in greater satisfaction among your employees, lower turnover, and higher productivity. On top of all that, its just nicer to be around happy people. Don't you agree?
